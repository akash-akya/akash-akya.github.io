<p>Most films are made by production houses aiming to attract large audiences and generate substantial revenue. The preferences of the majority dictate the types of movies that get made, with pleasing the crowd taking precedence over aspects like storytelling, artistic vision, and innovation. This naturally results in a standardized movie template: a star-studded cast, larger-than-life characters, elaborate action sequences, and the familiar three-part <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey">Hero&rsquo;s Journey</a> story structure, with some variations. Superhero movies, horror flicks, war dramas, westerns, and all-encompassing &ldquo;mass&rdquo; movies in the Indian context adhere to this formula. While there&rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with these movies â€” after all, they are made because people enjoy them and continue to watch. But they lack individuality and innovation.</p>
<p>However, on the opposite end of the spectrum lie movies that discard audience demands in favor of exploring the possibilities in cinema. Strong artistic voice of the makers shapes the movie. Ignoring audience is not always bad thig, audience might not  You cannot invent a car by trying to optimize a carriage. Even if these films aren&rsquo;t to everyone&rsquo;s taste, they stand out from the crowd. And they are anything but bland. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt27404067/">&ldquo;Photo&rdquo;</a> is one such movie.</p>
<h3 id="genre">Genre</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Photo,&rdquo; directed by Utsav Gonwar, is an emotional drama with a strong political narrative. But unlike mainstream films, which often feature a charismatic male lead delivering long speeches to masses, &ldquo;Photo&rdquo; relies on the visual and auditory elements of cinema to convey its political message. Cinema does not always have to be a collection of dialogues with video. &ldquo;Photo&rdquo; speaks for itself rather than through a character.</p>
<h3 id="plot">Plot</h3>
<p>The narrative centers around a village boy and his family&rsquo;s struggles during the COVID-19 lockdown. Viewers experience the story through the eyes of the boy from North Karnataka, who dreams of having his photo taken in front of Vidhana Soudha, while his father, a low-wage construction worker in Bangalore, struggles to make ends meet. The movie highlights the disconnect between the ruling authority and the common man. The underprivileged working class is always at the receiving end of the atrocities created by the ruling party. Viewers mostly hear their voice or see them on TV announcing new laws, and <em>this absence</em> serves as a stark reminder of their disconnect from the reality of the working class.</p>
<h3 id="cinematic-mastery">Cinematic Mastery</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Photo&rdquo; is shot beautifully and is a visual poetry, to the extent that one can watch the movie without audio, and still like it for the composition. It perfectly uses the North Karnataka landscape for the story; when characters are placed in the barren landscapes of North Karnataka on a brutally hot day, you feel the desolation and despair. The attention to detail is praiseworthy, and it adds realism to the movie; you can see that in scenes showcasing village school, people doing chores, kids playing marbles, and the village fight. The movie uses the Raichur region dialect of Kannada, and it feels very natural and authentic, especially the usage of the slangs. In most movies, regional languages are used for amusement and humor, not as an integral part of the story, but here it very much is part of the story.</p>
<p>Movie editing is very well done. Subdued colors, detailed composition, lack of background music, absence of rushed quick cuts enhance the film&rsquo;s documentary-style realism. I especially like the lingering pause it has at the end. It is just a few scenes, but it gives the audience a moment to fully grasp what happened, and that adds gravity to the scene.</p>
<p>While watching the movie, I was constantly reminded of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_neorealism">neorealism</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_Thieves">Bicycle Thieves</a> and the father-son dynamics. The aesthetics of showcasing the arid landscape and the use of rural language can be compared to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebbles_(film)">Koozhangal</a> (Pebbles) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thithi_(film)">Thithi</a>.</p>
<h3 id="memorable-moments">Memorable Moments</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Haunting Aerial Shot</strong>: a long shot of the father traversing barren plains on a hot day. The slow zoom out revealing the landscape is captivating. The sound of the air as we move up enhances the scene.</li>
<li><strong>Mother&rsquo;s Anguish</strong>: a tracking camera shot following the mother as we wait with her for the tragic news.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is subtle humor, as irony and juxtaposition. One example is the scene with the father and son standing and watching this bizarre lockdown march entering the frame and exiting.</p>
<h3 id="personal-experience">Personal Experience</h3>
<p>I wanted to watch the movie ever since I heard about it on The Bangalore Film Festival website last year. Usually, such experimental movies do not see the light of release, and the only hope is to wait for an OTT release, so I was not really holding my breath. But I got lucky this time, and the movie got released. There were barely 15 people in the theater on the second day of its release.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Photo&rdquo; is by no means a perfect movie, but I felt it captures the COVID disaster and political mismanagement with an emotional story. As someone who grew up near the region depicted in the movie, I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a connection to the story, language, and characters. My high praise might be biased by the connection and the alignment in political stance. I am not sure how well all the intrinsic details translate to someone who is not familiar with it. Its niche appeal may limit its box-office success. It is a risk moviemakers have to take, and for selfish reasons, I am glad they did.</p>
