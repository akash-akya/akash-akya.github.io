<strong><em>Note that following article is dated and my opinions changed significantly since then</em></strong></p>
<p>
While reading <a href="http://sarabander.github.io/sicp/">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> book
(sicp for short), I was amazed by how well the topics are explained.
At first glance, the book looks like it&#39;s about programming, but it&#39;s
actually more than that. Even though I&#39;m still at chapter 3, I&#39;m
already in love with the book. Among other things it truly changes the
way of thinking in general. All these things got me into thinking what
made sicp so special? Why not all other topics are explained in
such a manner in general teaching?  I think among other things it&#39;s
the explaining things with a mixture of natural language and a formal
language. switching between them whenever necessary. Natural language
for explaining common topics and formal languages for explaining
&#34;definite&#34; topics. The formal language I mean programming language. As
I&#39;m interested in linguistics, I have been thinking why not use this
innate ability of programming languages to teach other topics as well
and get the same benefit?. I firmly believe this is to be true. That&#39;s
a bold claim! Let&#39;s see a few points which I think backs up this
claim. This idea may not be something new. My main intention in
writing this to get a clear picture for me and have a discussion
with others to improve my understanding.</p>

Premises
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The key difference between natural language and formal language is ambiguity or inexactness. Its surprising to see how we even make sense of any natural language sentence. The framing of words,
 sentences, sounds(phonetics) everything is full of special cases. There is no single generic rule (or grammar) for these things. The natural language I mean the language we all learn, the one we speak. Not the one taught in school, which is more of standardized language. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language">constructed language</a>.</p>
<p>
 Ambiguity in natural languages mainly due to its reliance on context to make sense. When someone says &#34;Write your name&#34;, it&#39;s grammatically correct but it&#39;s unclear whether he is asking to write the name of the person or to write &#34;your name&#34;. Though we make sense of sentences like this daily. Formal languages are exactly opposite in this regard. By definition they are unambiguous. A formal language sentence can&#39;t have two different meanings. That&#39;s why we have a
 special formal language for mathematics.</p>

Programming language
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Programming language a formal language. When we think of programming
language we usually think of &#34;telling&#34; computer what to
do. Programming languages are now separated enough from the computer
that we can now write programs without actually understanding how the
computer works.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-3">
So what?
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Just as natural language serves as a tool for thinking, we can use a
 the programming language to understand things better or easier; as a tool for education. We can use a programming language to understand topics which are &#39;exact&#39; in nature. We have mathematics for the exact same
 reason but I think a programming language huge benefit over it. not
 only that mathematics have various confusing different notations
 (does &lt;code&gt;d(x+1)/dx&lt;/code&gt; means division or differentiation) it
 also unifies all different notation for describing things which are
 &#39;exact&#39;.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-5">
For understanding.
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-4">
<p>DSL (Domain Specific Language) with and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop">REPL</a> kind of environment is
the best tool to just try out different possibilities. Take the
example of understanding kinetics. In the current model of teaching
students are taught some rules and formulas and some clich√© examples
and expected to understand and get intuition. Instead, if you provide
an environment with proper DSL for the topic (maybe be some fancy
animation), students can explore possibilities to get the intuition of
the topic. One might ask &#34;why bother with a programming language? a
simple UI with GUI elements such as seek-bar and an input box to
change parameter is more than enough!&#34;. but only so much you can do
with the limited combination, instead if we provide the ability to
combine different things (such as ability to try different formula
itself), students can try different combinations of the rules and
figure out why things are the way they are. What we are essentially
giving here is the ability to &#34;change&#34; and &#34;define&#34; the rules
itself. Unlike playing along with the already defined rules, which
traditional teaching promotes. This ability to combine and define
different things cannot be fully realized without a language,
language&#39;s recursive nature is very essential in combination.</p>

For experimenting
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-4">
<p>To understand a topic, experimenting with it is essential, current
model of teaching provides very less importance to experimenting.
Programming languages might fill that gap and give easy means to
&#39;experiment&#39; and pattern match the results. Seeing the changes
immediately makes the learning more interesting and more
involved. Bret Victor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUv66718DII">talk on &#34;Inventing on Principle&#34;</a> may be relevant
here.</p>

<h4 id="headline-7">
For expressing
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-4">
<p>I often find myself struggling to explain topics which are &#34;mathsy&#34; or
related to logic. Almost always I end up mixing words from the programming
language and natural language. Having common languages explain these
sort of things might solve this problem. Maths fill this void but
partially because of lack of uniformity. A common programming language
might fill this gap. It can act like a natural language for explaining
topic leaned towards logic.</p>

<h4 id="headline-8">
As a tool to hide the complexity
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-4">
<p>All high-level programming language has a weapon called &#34;Abstraction&#34;
to fight complexity. Abstraction is a tool to hide complexity by
separating problem into layers. This aspect can be utilized to make
teaching focused on one topic or layer. Like having a DSL and
explaining the topics incrementally make the topic at hand simple and
focused. Sicp has a various example illustrating this. Especially
picture language, explaining the combination of drawing first and then
explaining the drawing primitive. This aspect forces us to think why
we have to define primitives in the first place. Another example of
finding square root is the best to showcase how things can be
explained incrementally. Gradually explaining the fixed point formula
is arguably the best way to explain some topic. Though abstraction is
not unique to a programming language, programming language forces us
to think in a certain way and draws the clear line between layers of
abstraction.  From my personal experience understanding and
implementing
<a href="https://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/723/Lambda/church.html">church
numerals</a> was a insightful experience. I think It is possible because
of clear abstraction.</p>

For evaluation
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-4">
<p>With the current model students are evaluated based on their
&#34;explanation&#34; of the topic or asking for things they &#34;remember&#34;. I
don&#39;t think explanation actually reveal much about
understanding. Sometimes they can&#39;t explain the intuition they
have. Ability to explain is definitely a good thing to have but that
should not be a measure to evaluate understanding. Evaluating practical activity which utilizes their understanding might be
better. For example, to evaluate students understanding of kinetics, we
can provide a physics environment with slightly different DSL to the
student. And can ask them to show or create something in that
environment based on the understanding.</p>

Just as a language, for its own sake!
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Same as natural languages, we can explore programming language to
create/express art. There are already various examples, which use
programming language as a tool to create something. To name few <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">sonic
pi</a> for sound processing and <a href="https://processing.org/">processing</a> for generative art and all
other kinds of visual art.</p>

What languages should we use?
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-3">
<p>All this fine and dandy only if we have a simple language. If teaching language itself is a big hurdle then there is no point in doing so. Current programming languages are more focused on
 &#34;programming&#34; aspect, we need something more &#39;simple&#39;(no pointer etc). As this is a tool for explaining general topics. I think something like Lisp fits perfectly. Its simple enough that basic syntax can be explained in 4-5 hours and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homoiconic</a> nature blurs the line between code and data distinction which is essential <sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>. obviously, I&#39;m biased because of sicp.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-2" href="#footnote-2">2</a></sup> The point is it&#39;s not about the language&#39;s syntax but the properties of all high-level language.</p>

Final thoughts
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-3">
<p>There is no doubt that we understand some topic better with a
 different approach or explained using a different medium (for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr">Explaining calculus visually</a>). The languages we use might actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_and_thought">affect our thinking</a>. We just have to try. Using programming language for teaching is partially explored. For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)">scratch</a> (But
 the goal is different though).  Maybe using formal language is not that effective in practice or maybe teaching the language itself is a big problem. But It&#39;s worth exploring</p>
