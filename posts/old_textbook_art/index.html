<p>I recently got into digging old Kannada books from archive.org. By
<em>old</em> I mean long before my great grandfather was born. Some of them
are dated 1865!  While the language, topic, even the examples they
take sounds raw, odd, or weird. But it&rsquo;s not difficult read and
understand. On the contrary, I think more people might understand this
language than the current one we use in publishing. Part of it might
be because of the lesser usage of Sanskrit words which is more in the
current publishing. And since at that time there was no &ldquo;standard
language for publishing&rdquo; each book uses its own dialect and tone. You
can even map the region of the dialect since it&rsquo;s very similar to
current spoken regional dialects.</p>
<p>Main reason I got interested in old books apart of language is that, a
book is essentially a window to different time-space. We get to see a
world from a wildly different eyes. Sometimes their worldview can be
odd, offensive from today&rsquo;s viewpoint. And other times it appears so
familiar. It is interesting to think how the generation after 150
years will look at us! Anyway, I&rsquo;ll save the rant for some other
time. For now, let&rsquo;s see these photo-realistic arts I found in a
<a href="https://archive.org/details/dli.56E276/mode/2up">first standard
textbook</a> published
in 1906.</p>
<p>The composition and details suggest that these are based on real
photographs. My initial guess was that these were halftone prints.
But it is not, these are created from different stroke patterns of
varying size, producing a much more detailed print than halftone can
produce. My best guess is its created using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stipple_engraving">Stipple
engraving</a>
technique. A skilled artist might have created the engravings by
tracing the original photograph. What makes it even more interesting
is that all these effort they put into a first standard textbook in
1906 for a regional language in India. I don&rsquo;t think many kids even
went to school at that time, let alone having books. The quality of
the print is no less than modern books. From the scan, we can clearly
see that the prints are very clean without any sort of smudge which
was common in my childhood text books which was published 100 years
after this. I couldn&rsquo;t find any artifacts in the print.</p>
