<p>I bought Honda CB300R last December. These are the few things I learned after spending time with it.</p>

<p><strong>Tyre Pressure</strong></p>
<p>Precise tyre pressure can truly transform your riding experience – it&rsquo;s a small detail that makes a big difference!</p>
<p>Initially, I used to maintain tyre pressure slightly above the recommended level. This gave my bike&rsquo;s handling a nimble edge and made navigating tight corners a breeze on my arms. The manual suggested 29 psi for the front and 33 psi for the rear, but I would inflate up to 32 psi and 34.</p>
<p>Even though my bike felt smoother, the ride was not comfortable. Every little bump or hole in the road felt like a big deal, especially on our rough Indian roads. I initially assumed this stiffness is due to the bike&rsquo;s suspension tuning, for the better stability during the cornering.</p>
<p>Several weeks later, I decided to invest in a pressure gauge for precise tracking. I was shocked to see that the air pressure was way off! Displaying an alarming 48 psi, I thought the gauge was broken, so I went to a nearby puncture shop. The mechanic showed that my tyres were actually below 25 psi and adjusted them to 32 psi. Just to make sure, I went to another shop, and it showed 28 psi. Unconvinced by these varied readings, so I tried three more shops, and they all had different numbers - ±5 psi apart. That&rsquo;s a big difference!</p>
<p>Doubt set in; some of these readings had to be wrong. However, with no means to get accurate tyre pressure in my small town, I found myself purchasing yet another gauge. This time, a slightly expensive a Michelin gauge.</p>
<p>As expected, the Michelin gauge mirrored my first gauge reading. It became evident that all the gauges in local puncture shops were terribly bad! Their error rate was staggering, off by approximately 15 psi!</p>
<p>Once I put the right amount of air in my tyres like the manual said, my ride got so much better.  The bike handled bumps way better and felt way smoother. I got used to the handlebars being a little firmer, and I hardly noticing it anymore. Most significantly, the bike felt more grounded, showing better traction on sandy and slippery corners.</p>
<p>Key Takeaway: Always keep a reliable pressure gauge on hand, and place your trust in the manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended tyre pressure. Don&rsquo;t solely rely on the local shop&rsquo;s gauge.</p>
